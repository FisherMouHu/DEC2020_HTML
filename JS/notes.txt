1. Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER Vs Number.MAX_VALUE

this: points to the object that invokes the function containing the this keyword.


can you tell what's the diff between apply and call?

apply expects all parameters to be passed individaully 
but call expects the second parameter to be an array

Bind: The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided object.

call: call() calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually.

bind VS call
1. call accepts additional parameters 
2. call executes the function right away
3. call does not make a copy of the function being called

** arrow funs do not have "arguments"

Q. copy of the array, without spread
push every element of a source arry to a new array?  
Array.from()

** A function can return another function. A function which is 
assigned to a variable is called a function expression.


Arrow fns charactersitics:
1. do not have this
2. do not have arguments
3. cant be called with new
4. do not have super
